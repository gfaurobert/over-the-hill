Hill Charts are a great way to visually communicate progress and incoming work.

Read [Shape Up: Show Porgress (Chapt. 13)](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.4-chapter-13) to discover the technique.

## What is Over The Hill?

Over The Hill is a web and desktop application designed to visualize project progress using a "Hill Chart." A Hill Chart is a simple yet powerful tool for tracking the status of tasks or features, categorizing them into two main phases: "Up the Hill" (discovery/problem-solving) and "Down the Hill" (execution/implementation).

This app allows you to:

  

* **Create and manage "dots"**: Each dot represents a task, feature, or item you want to track.

* **Position dots on the hill**: Drag and drop dots to indicate their progress. Dots on the left side are "Up the Hill" (still figuring things out), and dots on the right side are "Down the Hill" (known work, being executed).

* **Customize dots**: Assign names, colors (blue, green, red, orange, purple), and sizes (1-5) to each dot for better categorization and visual distinction.

* **Organize with collections**: Group related dots into collections to manage multiple projects or different aspects of a single project.

* **Export your chart**: Copy the generated hill chart as a PNG image or an SVG file to your clipboard, or download it as a PNG file, for easy sharing and documentation.

* **Theme support**: Switch between light, dark, or system-preferred themes for a comfortable viewing experience.

  

## How to Use

  

1. **Add Dots**: Click the "Add Dot" button to create a new task or item.

2. **Name and Customize**: In the dot editing panel, give your dot a name, and select its color and size using the dropdowns.

3. **Position on the Hill**: Drag the dot on the hill chart to reflect its current status.

* **Up the Hill (Left Side)**: For tasks where you're still exploring, researching, or solving problems.

* **Down the Hill (Right Side)**: For tasks where the path is clear, and you're actively implementing.

4. **Manage Collections**: Use the "Collections" dropdown to create new collections, switch between them, or manage existing ones.

5. **Export/Share**:

* Click the ellipsis menu (`...`) in the top right corner.

* Under "Export Clipboard Format," choose "Copy as PNG" or "Copy as SVG" to set the clipboard format.

* Click the "Copy" button in the chart header to copy the chart to your clipboard in the selected format.

* Click the "Download PNG" button to save the chart as a PNG file to your system.

6. **Theme Switching**: Use the ellipsis menu (`...`) to toggle between "Light," "Dark," or "Follow Browser" themes.

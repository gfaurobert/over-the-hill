## Typography Examples

This theme uses the **Inter font family** for excellent readability across all devices. The typography is carefully designed to provide a comfortable reading experience with proper line heights and spacing.

### Headings

The theme includes properly styled headings that create a clear hierarchy:

- **H1**: Main page titles (like the one above)
- **H2**: Section headings (like this one)
- **H3**: Subsection headings
- **H4**: Minor headings

### Text Styling

You can use various text styling options:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Inline code` for technical terms
- [Links](https://example.com) for references

## Code Examples

The theme includes beautiful syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is an example HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

```css
/* Example CSS */
body {
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
}

.container {
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 2rem;
}
```

## Lists and Content

The theme handles various content types beautifully:

### Unordered Lists
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with a [link](https://example.com)

### Ordered Lists
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Blockquotes

Notice the sidebar navigation on the left? It automatically shows all your pages and provides easy navigation between content. On mobile devices, you can access the navigation using the menu button.

## Next Steps - Test

Now that you've seen how the theme works, you can:

1. **Add more content** by creating new `.md` files in the `content` directory
2. **Customize the design** by modifying the CSS variables in the base template
3. **Add images** by placing them in the `static` directory
4. **Create different content types** by organizing files in subdirectories

The theme is designed to be both beautiful and functional, making it perfect for documentation sites, blogs, or any content-focused website.

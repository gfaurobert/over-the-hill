## 🎉 What's New in v0.0.2

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Date Handling in Snapshots**: Resolved issue where snapshots were created with the next day's date due to timezone conversion

  - Addresses issue where users in different timezones experienced incorrect snapshot dates

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

# Hello World

Welcome to your first page with the modern Hugo theme! This page demonstrates the beautiful typography and layout features of your new site.

## Typography Examples

This theme uses the **Inter font family** for excellent readability across all devices. The typography is carefully designed to provide a comfortable reading experience with proper line heights and spacing.

### Headings

The theme includes properly styled headings that create a clear hierarchy:

- **H1**: Main page titles (like the one above)
- **H2**: Section headings (like this one)
- **H3**: Subsection headings
- **H4**: Minor headings

### Text Styling

You can use various text styling options:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Inline code` for technical terms
- [Links](https://example.com) for references

## Code Examples

The theme includes beautiful syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is an example HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

```css
/* Example CSS */
body {
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
}

.container {
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 2rem;
}
```

## Lists and Content

### Unordered Lists

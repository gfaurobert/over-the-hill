# Over The Hill - Web Application Presentation Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Opening Scene - Show the landing page]**

"Salut les PM! Today I'm excited to show you **Over The Hill**, a web application for project progress using Hill Charts - a methodology created by 37signals and detailed in their book 'Shape Up'.

**[Brief pause while showing the interface]**

Hill Charts are an intuitive way to track where your projects really stand. Unlike traditional progress bars that only show completion percentage, Hill Charts show you *what kind* of work is happening."

## What Are Hill Charts? (45 seconds)

**[Show a simple hill chart visualization]**

"Let me explain the concept quickly. Imagine your project as a journey over a hill:

- **Left side - 'Up the Hill'**: This represents the discovery phase. You're still figuring things out, solving problems, researching, and exploring unknowns.
- **Top of the Hill**: The moment when you've figured it out - you know exactly what needs to be done.
- **Right side - 'Down the Hill'**: This is pure execution. The path is clear, and you're implementing the solution.

This gives you immediate insight into whether a project is stuck in research hell or moving steadily toward completion."

## Core Features Demo (3-4 minutes)

### Creating Your First Collection (45 seconds)

**[Show collection creation]**

"Once you're logged in, you'll see the main Hill Chart interface. Let's start by creating a new collection. Think of collections as different projects or workstreams.

**[Click 'Add Collection']**
I'll create a collection called 'Website Redesign Project'. 

You can have multiple collections to organize different projects - maybe one for your mobile app, another for your marketing campaign, and another for your internal tools."

### Adding and Customizing Dots (1 minute)

**[Demo dot creation and customization]**

"Now let's add some tasks or features. I'll enter a dot name to create our first item.

**[Show the dot editing interface]**
Each dot represents a task, feature, or work item. Let me add:
- 'User Research' - I'll make this red and size 3 to show it's important
- 'Design System' - Green, size 2
- 'Frontend Development' - Blue, size 4 for a major component
- 'Testing & QA' - Orange, size 2

Notice how I can customize each dot with:
- **Names**: Clear, descriptive labels
- **Colors**: Blue, green, red, orange, purple for categorization
- **Sizes**: 1-5 to indicate scope or importance"

### Positioning on the Hill (1 minute)

**[Demo drag and drop functionality]**

"Now comes the magic - positioning these dots on the hill chart. This is where the real insight happens.

**[Drag dots to different positions]**
- 'User Research' - I'll place this on the left side, up the hill, because we're still gathering insights
- 'Design System' - Moving toward the top, we're starting to figure this out
- 'Frontend Development' - This goes on the right side, down the hill, because we know exactly what to build
- 'Testing & QA' - Far left, because we haven't even started thinking about this yet

See how this immediately shows the state of our project? Some items are in discovery, others are in execution."

### Snapshot System (45 seconds)

**[Demo snapshot creation and navigation]**

"One of my favorite features is the snapshot system. I can capture the current state of my project at any time.

**[Click snapshot button]**
Let me create a snapshot for today. Now I can track progress over time.

**[Show calendar navigation]**
The calendar interface lets me navigate through different snapshots. Green dots indicate days with saved snapshots. This is perfect for weekly standups or progress reviews - you can literally see how your project has moved over time."

### Export Capabilities (30 seconds)

**[Demo export features]**

"When it's time to share your progress, Over The Hill makes it incredibly easy.

**[Show export menu]**
From the ellipsis menu, I can:
- Copy the chart as PNG to my clipboard for quick sharing in Slack or email
- Copy as SVG for scalable graphics
- Download as PNG for presentations

**[Demo copying to clipboard]**
I'll copy this as PNG... and now I can paste it directly into any document or chat."

## Advanced Features (1 minute)

### Theme Support (15 seconds)

**[Demo theme switching]**

"The app supports light, dark, and system themes. Let me switch to dark mode - perfect for those late-night project sessions."

### Import/Export Data (20 seconds)

**[Show import/export functionality]**

"For data portability, you can export your entire project as JSON for backup or import data from other tools. This ensures you never lose your work and can migrate between systems easily."

### Multiple Collections Management (25 seconds)

**[Demo switching between collections]**

"Let me create another collection for a different project... 'Mobile App Launch'. See how I can quickly switch between different projects? Each collection maintains its own set of dots and snapshots, giving you complete project isolation."

## Real-World Use Cases (1 minute)

**[Keep showing the interface while explaining]**

"Over The Hill is perfect for:

- **Product teams** tracking feature development across discovery and delivery phases
- **Project managers** getting honest status updates - no more 'everything is 90% done'
- **Development teams** visualizing technical work and identifying bottlenecks
- **Individuals** managing personal projects and side hustles
- **Agencies** providing clear progress updates to clients

The visual nature makes it incredibly easy to spot when projects are stuck in research or when you're moving too fast without proper discovery."

## Benefits & Value Proposition (45 seconds)

**[Show a completed hill chart with multiple dots]**

"What makes Hill Charts so powerful is the honesty they bring to project tracking:

- **No false precision**: Instead of fake percentage estimates, you get honest position data
- **Immediate insights**: Spot bottlenecks and stuck projects at a glance
- **Better communication**: Visual status that anyone can understand
- **Historical tracking**: See how your project velocity changes over time
- **Flexible organization**: Handle multiple projects with ease

And because it's cloud-based, your entire team can stay synchronized on project status."

## Conclusion & Next Steps (30 seconds)

**[Show the main interface one final time]**

"Over The Hill transforms how you think about and communicate project progress. It's currently available as an invite-only SaaS platform at over-the-hill.faurobert.fr.

If you're interested in trying it out, you can request access directly through the application. There's also comprehensive documentation available to help you get started.

Thank you for watching, and I hope you'll give Hill Charts a try for your next project!"

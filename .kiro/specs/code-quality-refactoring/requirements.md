# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical code quality issues identified in the Over The Hill codebase through systematic refactoring. The current HillChartApp component has grown to 2854 lines and violates multiple software engineering principles, making it difficult to maintain, test, and extend. This refactoring will improve code maintainability, performance, type safety, accessibility, and testing coverage while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Architecture Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the HillChartApp component split into smaller, focused components, so that the codebase is easier to understand, maintain, and test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HillChartApp component is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into at least 5 separate components with single responsibilities
2. WHEN components are created THEN each component SHALL have fewer than 300 lines of code
3. WHEN components are created THEN each component SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the HillChart component SHALL only handle chart visualization and dot interactions
5. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the CollectionManager component SHALL only handle collection CRUD operations
6. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the DotManager component SHALL only handle dot management operations
7. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the SnapshotManager component SHALL only handle snapshot operations
8. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 2: State Management Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complex state logic extracted into custom hooks, so that state management is more organized and reusable across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state management is refactored THEN custom hooks SHALL be created for collections, dots, snapshots, and release line settings
2. WHEN custom hooks are implemented THEN each hook SHALL manage only related state and operations
3. WHEN the useCollections hook is created THEN it SHALL handle all collection-related state and operations
4. WHEN the useDots hook is created THEN it SHALL handle all dot-related state and operations
5. WHEN the useSnapshots hook is created THEN it SHALL handle all snapshot-related state and operations
6. WHEN custom hooks are implemented THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and loading states
7. WHEN custom hooks are implemented THEN they SHALL use proper TypeScript types without any usage

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform smoothly with large datasets, so that I can work efficiently with many collections and dots.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance optimizations are implemented THEN expensive calculations SHALL be memoized using useMemo
2. WHEN dot rendering is optimized THEN dots SHALL be memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. WHEN user interactions occur THEN callbacks SHALL be memoized using useCallback to prevent child re-renders
4. WHEN dot positions are updated THEN updates SHALL be debounced to reduce API calls
5. WHEN large lists are displayed THEN virtual scrolling SHALL be implemented for collections and snapshots with more than 50 items
6. WHEN the hill chart path is calculated THEN it SHALL be memoized since it never changes
7. WHEN performance optimizations are complete THEN the application SHALL maintain 60fps during dot dragging operations

### Requirement 4: Type Safety Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strict TypeScript types throughout the codebase, so that type-related bugs are caught at compile time and code is more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN type safety is enhanced THEN all any types SHALL be replaced with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL use discriminated unions for better type safety where appropriate
3. WHEN component props are defined THEN they SHALL have strict TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN service methods are defined THEN they SHALL have proper return type annotations
5. WHEN error types are defined THEN they SHALL extend proper base error classes with specific properties
6. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN TypeScript strict mode SHALL pass without errors
7. WHEN generic types are used THEN they SHALL have proper constraints and defaults

### Requirement 5: Error Handling Improvement

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling throughout the application, so that I receive clear feedback when issues occur and the application remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error handling is improved THEN React Error Boundaries SHALL be implemented to catch component errors
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized by type (validation, network, storage, etc.)
3. WHEN service errors occur THEN they SHALL be wrapped in custom error classes with proper context
4. WHEN errors are displayed to users THEN they SHALL show actionable error messages
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
6. WHEN the cache service fails THEN it SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking the application
7. WHEN network requests fail THEN users SHALL see appropriate retry options

### Requirement 6: Accessibility Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers, so that I can use all features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility is enhanced THEN all interactive elements SHALL have proper ARIA labels
2. WHEN dots are displayed THEN they SHALL be keyboard navigable using arrow keys
3. WHEN menus are opened THEN they SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation
4. WHEN form elements are present THEN they SHALL have proper labels and descriptions
5. WHEN error messages are shown THEN they SHALL be announced to screen readers
6. WHEN the application is tested THEN it SHALL pass WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
7. WHEN keyboard navigation is implemented THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible

### Requirement 7: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all components and services, so that regressions are caught early and code quality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing infrastructure is improved THEN each new component SHALL have unit tests with at least 80% coverage
2. WHEN integration tests are added THEN they SHALL cover complete user workflows
3. WHEN component tests are written THEN they SHALL test both happy path and error scenarios
4. WHEN service tests are written THEN they SHALL mock external dependencies properly
5. WHEN accessibility tests are added THEN they SHALL verify ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
6. WHEN performance tests are added THEN they SHALL verify rendering performance benchmarks
7. WHEN the testing suite is complete THEN it SHALL run in under 30 seconds for unit tests

### Requirement 8: Service Layer Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean service layer architecture, so that business logic is separated from UI components and can be easily tested and reused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service layer is implemented THEN dedicated service classes SHALL be created for collections, dots, and snapshots
2. WHEN service classes are created THEN they SHALL have single responsibilities and clear interfaces
3. WHEN service methods are implemented THEN they SHALL handle their own error cases and validation

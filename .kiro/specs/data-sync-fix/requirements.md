# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical data synchronization issues in the Over The Hill application where local cached data becomes stale and out of sync with the remote database. Users experience outdated collection and dot states after making changes, refreshing the page, or returning after periods of inactivity. The issue affects all data types including collections, dots, and snapshots, requiring users to clear site data to see current state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my changes to be immediately reflected in the UI after any data modification, so that I always see the current state of my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates, updates, moves, renames, or archives a dot THEN the system SHALL immediately update both the remote database and invalidate related local cache
2. WHEN a user creates, updates, or deletes a collection THEN the system SHALL immediately update both the remote database and invalidate related local cache
3. WHEN a user creates or deletes a snapshot THEN the system SHALL immediately update both the remote database and invalidate related local cache
4. WHEN any data modification occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure the UI reflects the change without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the most current data when I refresh the page or navigate between collections, so that I don't work with outdated information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data from the remote database instead of serving cached data
2. WHEN a user selects a different collection THEN the system SHALL fetch the latest collection data from the remote database
3. WHEN a user returns to a previously viewed collection THEN the system SHALL verify cache freshness and fetch updated data if needed
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators during data fetching operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically handle cache invalidation and data synchronization, so that I don't encounter stale data issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application detects potential cache staleness THEN the system SHALL automatically invalidate affected cache entries
2. WHEN a user logs in after a period of inactivity THEN the system SHALL force a complete data refresh from the remote database
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL implement cache versioning to detect and handle stale cache scenarios
4. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states to indicate data is being refreshed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle session management intelligently, so that I don't encounter authentication-related data sync issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has been inactive for a configurable period THEN the system SHALL automatically log out the user to prevent stale session issues
2. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL clear all local cached data and redirect to login
3. WHEN a user logs back in after session expiry THEN the system SHALL fetch all data fresh from the remote database
4. WHEN session validation fails THEN the system SHALL clear local cache and require re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to scale efficiently with large numbers of collections, so that performance remains good as my data grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for collection data instead of loading everything upfront
2. WHEN a user has more than 50 collections THEN the system SHALL paginate or virtualize the collection list
3. WHEN a collection is selected THEN the system SHALL load only that collection's data on-demand
4. WHEN switching between collections THEN the system SHALL maintain a reasonable cache size limit and evict least recently used data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when data is being synchronized, so that I understand when operations are in progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is being fetched from the remote database THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN a data modification is being saved THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback of the save operation
3. WHEN cache is being refreshed THEN the system SHALL show a subtle indicator that data is being updated
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle offline scenarios gracefully, so that I can continue working when connectivity is intermittent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user goes offline THEN the system SHALL detect the offline state and inform the user
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL allow read-only access to cached data with clear indicators that data may be stale
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync any pending changes and refresh stale data
4. WHEN conflicts arise during sync THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms or clear error messages

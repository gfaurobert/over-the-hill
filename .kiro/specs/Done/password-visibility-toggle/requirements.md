# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a password visibility toggle to login forms, allowing users to show or hide their password while typing. This improves user experience by helping users verify they've entered their password correctly, especially on mobile devices or when using complex passwords.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user logging into the application, I want to toggle password visibility so that I can verify I've entered my password correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on a login form THEN I SHALL see a toggle button (eye icon) next to the password field
2. WHEN I click the toggle button THEN the password field SHALL switch between hidden (dots/asterisks) and visible (plain text) display
3. WHEN the password is visible THEN the toggle button SHALL show an "eye-off" or "hide" icon
4. WHEN the password is hidden THEN the toggle button SHALL show an "eye" or "show" icon
5. WHEN I toggle password visibility THEN the cursor position in the password field SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the password visibility toggle to be accessible so that I can use it with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate using the keyboard THEN I SHALL be able to focus on the password visibility toggle button
2. WHEN the toggle button is focused THEN I SHALL be able to activate it using the Enter or Space key
3. WHEN using a screen reader THEN the toggle button SHALL have appropriate aria-label text describing its current state
4. WHEN the password visibility changes THEN screen readers SHALL announce the new state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the password visibility toggle to work consistently across all login forms so that I have a uniform experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on the main sign-in form (SignInForm component) THEN I SHALL see the password visibility toggle
2. WHEN I am on any other login form in the application THEN I SHALL see the same password visibility toggle behavior
3. WHEN I toggle password visibility on any form THEN the visual design SHALL be consistent with the application's theme
4. WHEN using dark or light theme THEN the toggle button SHALL display appropriately for the current theme

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the password visibility toggle to maintain security best practices so that my password remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the password is visible THEN it SHALL only be visible in the current browser tab/window
2. WHEN I navigate away from the login form THEN the password field SHALL automatically return to hidden state
3. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the password visibility state SHALL not affect the security of the password transmission
4. WHEN the page is refreshed or reloaded THEN the password field SHALL default to hidden state

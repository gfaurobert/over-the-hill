# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The access request system currently allows users to submit requests successfully, but there's no notification mechanism for administrators. This feature will add email notifications using Nodemailer to alert administrators when new access requests are submitted, providing them with the requester's email and message for review.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to receive an email notification when someone submits an access request, so that I can promptly review and respond to new requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully submits an access request THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to the configured administrator email
2. WHEN the email is sent THEN it SHALL include the requester's email address and their message
3. WHEN the email notification fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but still allow the access request to be stored successfully
4. WHEN the access request has no message THEN the email SHALL indicate that no message was provided

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to receive professional-looking email notifications, so that I can easily identify and process access requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the notification email is sent THEN it SHALL have a clear, professional subject line indicating it's an access request
2. WHEN the email is composed THEN it SHALL include a well-formatted HTML template with the requester's information
3. WHEN displaying the requester's message THEN it SHALL be properly formatted and escaped for security
4. WHEN the email is sent THEN it SHALL use the configured SMTP settings from environment variables

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the email notification system to be reliable and secure, so that sensitive information is handled properly and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL use the existing SMTP configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN there are SMTP connection issues THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the access request flow
3. WHEN processing the requester's message THEN the system SHALL sanitize the content to prevent email injection attacks
4. WHEN the email service is unavailable THEN the access request SHALL still be stored successfully in the database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to be able to easily respond to access requests, so that I can efficiently manage user onboarding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the notification email is received THEN it SHALL include the requester's email address in a format that allows easy reply
2. WHEN viewing the email THEN it SHALL clearly display the timestamp of when the request was submitted
3. WHEN the requester provided a message THEN it SHALL be prominently displayed in the email body
4. WHEN no message was provided THEN the email SHALL clearly indicate this to avoid confusion

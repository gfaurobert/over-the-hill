# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Release Line feature allows users to display a vertical line at the end of the hill chart to mark important milestones, deadlines, or release dates. This visual indicator helps teams understand project timelines and target dates in relation to their current progress on the hill chart.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to toggle a release line on/off in my hill chart, so that I can choose when to display milestone information without cluttering the visualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the hill chart settings THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle control for the release line
2. WHEN the release line toggle is enabled THEN the system SHALL display a vertical line at the right edge of the hill chart
3. WHEN the release line toggle is disabled THEN the system SHALL hide the release line completely
4. WHEN the toggle state changes THEN the system SHALL persist the setting for the current collection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to customize the color of the release line, so that I can match it to my project's visual theme or indicate different types of milestones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the release line is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide a color picker control for the release line
2. WHEN the user selects a new color THEN the system SHALL immediately update the release line color in the hill chart
3. WHEN the user changes the color THEN the system SHALL persist the color setting for the current collection
4. WHEN no custom color is set THEN the system SHALL use a default color that contrasts well with both light and dark themes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to edit the text displayed on the release line, so that I can show relevant milestone information like dates, quarters, or custom labels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the release line is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide a text input field for the release line label
2. WHEN the user enters text THEN the system SHALL display the text vertically along or near the release line
3. WHEN the user updates the text THEN the system SHALL persist the text for the current collection
4. WHEN no custom text is provided THEN the system SHALL display a default placeholder or no text
5. WHEN the text is too long THEN the system SHALL handle text overflow gracefully (truncation or wrapping)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the release line to be visually integrated with the hill chart, so that it enhances rather than disrupts the overall visualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the release line is displayed THEN the system SHALL position it at the right edge of the hill chart area
2. WHEN the release line is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it extends the full height of the chart area
3. WHEN the release line text is displayed THEN the system SHALL position it to avoid overlapping with existing dots or chart elements
4. WHEN exporting the chart THEN the system SHALL include the release line in PNG and SVG exports if enabled
5. WHEN the chart is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain the release line position and proportions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the release line settings to be saved per collection, so that different projects can have different milestone configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between collections THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate release line settings for each collection
2. WHEN creating a new collection THEN the system SHALL use default release line settings
3. WHEN taking snapshots THEN the system SHALL preserve the release line state in the snapshot data
4. WHEN restoring from snapshots THEN the system SHALL restore the release line configuration along with the collection data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export and import release line settings with my collection data, so that I can share complete project configurations including milestone information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting collection data as JSON THEN the system SHALL include release line settings (enabled state, color, text) in the export
2. WHEN importing collection data from JSON THEN the system SHALL restore release line settings if present in the imported data
3. WHEN importing data without release line settings THEN the system SHALL use default release line configuration
4. WHEN the JSON import contains invalid release line data THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and use defaults

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want my release line text and color preferences to be encrypted, so that my project milestone information remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing release line text in the database THEN the system SHALL encrypt the text using the same encryption method as other user data
2. WHEN storing release line color preferences THEN the system SHALL encrypt the color values to maintain privacy
3. WHEN retrieving release line settings THEN the system SHALL decrypt the data before displaying it to the user
4. WHEN exporting encrypted collections THEN the system SHALL maintain encryption for release line data in the export format

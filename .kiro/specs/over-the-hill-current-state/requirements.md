# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Over the Hill is a comprehensive Hill Chart visualization SaaS application that helps teams and individuals track project progress using an intuitive bell curve interface. The application has evolved from a simple local storage tool into a full-featured multi-tenant platform with secure authentication, data persistence, and advanced collection management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Access Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure access to the application with invite-only registration, so that I can safely store and manage my project data.

6. WHEN dots have long names THEN the system SHALL limit label length to 32 characters for performance

### Requirement 3: Collection Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize my projects into separate collections, so that I can manage multiple projects independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new collection THEN the system SHALL add it to their collection list
2. WHEN a user selects a collection THEN the system SHALL display only the dots belonging to that collection
3. WHEN a user archives a collection THEN the system SHALL hide it from the active list while preserving all data
4. WHEN a user views archived collections THEN the system SHALL display them in a dedicated modal interface
5. WHEN a user unarchives a collection THEN the system SHALL restore it to the active collections list
6. WHEN a user deletes a collection THEN the system SHALL permanently remove it after confirmation

### Requirement 4: Dot Management and Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize dots with different colors, sizes, and labels, so that I can categorize and identify tasks effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a dot THEN the system SHALL allow setting label, color, and size properties
2. WHEN a user edits a dot THEN the system SHALL provide inline editing for all properties
3. WHEN a user selects a color THEN the system SHALL offer predefined color options (blue, green, red, orange, purple)
4. WHEN a user sets dot size THEN the system SHALL accept values from 1 to 5
5. WHEN a user archives a dot THEN the system SHALL hide it from the chart while preserving data
6. WHEN a user deletes a dot THEN the system SHALL remove it permanently after confirmation

### Requirement 5: Snapshot System

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create snapshots of my Hill Charts at different points in time, so that I can track progress history and compare states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a snapshot THEN the system SHALL save the current state of all dots in the collection
2. WHEN a user views snapshots THEN the system SHALL display them in a calendar interface
3. WHEN a user selects a snapshot date THEN the system SHALL load and display the historical state
4. WHEN a user navigates between snapshots THEN the system SHALL provide previous/next navigation
5. WHEN a user restores a snapshot THEN the system SHALL update the current collection to match the snapshot state

### Requirement 6: Data Export and Import

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export and import my Hill Chart data, so that I can backup my work and share it with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

# Active Tasks

## Current Task: Stack Overlapping Dot Names on Hill Chart
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement  

### Task Description
Fix the overlapping dot name labels on the hill chart so users can read all dot names clearly when dots are positioned close together. **✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED** with boundary-aware collision detection.

### Problem Analysis & Solutions ✅
- **Original Issue**: Dot labels overlapped when positioned horizontally close → **SOLVED with collision detection**
- **Critical Overflow Issue**: Stacked labels overflowed outside SVG viewBox boundaries → **SOLVED with boundary constraints** 
- **Export Compatibility**: Overflowed labels were cut off in PNG/SVG exports → **FIXED with bidirectional stacking**
- **TypeScript Errors**: 25+ type errors in collision detection functions → **RESOLVED with proper typing**

### Complete Implementation Results ✅

#### Successfully Implemented Features:
- **✅ Collision Detection**: Bounding box overlap detection between label rectangles
- **✅ Boundary-Aware Stacking**: Labels stay within SVG viewBox bounds (Y: 10-160)  
- **✅ Bidirectional Algorithm**: Upward stacking with downward fallback when needed
- **✅ Visual Hierarchy**: Progressive opacity gradations (1.0 → 0.97 → 0.95) for depth
- **✅ Export Compatibility**: All labels fully visible in PNG/SVG exports
- **✅ Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript type definitions and null safety

#### Technical Implementation Details:
- **LabelPosition Interface**: Comprehensive type definitions for collision detection
- **Boundary Constraints**: MIN_Y = 10, MAX_Y = 160 (within viewBox "-50 0 700 180")
- **Processing Logic**: Left-to-right sorting for predictable, consistent stacking
- **Null Safety**: Proper handling of draggingDot with conditional checks
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: O(n²) collision detection with early termination

### Plan & Subtasks - ALL COMPLETED ✅

#### A. VAN Phase Analysis ✅
- [x] Identified SVG rendering and collision detection requirements
- [x] Discovered critical boundary overflow issue affecting exports
- [x] Analyzed viewBox constraints and label positioning logic

#### B. PLAN Phase ✅  
- [x] Designed boundary-aware collision resolution algorithm
- [x] Planned bidirectional stacking (upward → downward fallback)
- [x] Defined safe boundaries and processing approach

#### C. CREATIVE Phase ✅
- [x] Designed clean visual stacking with opacity hierarchy
- [x] Maintained design consistency with existing hill chart aesthetic
- [x] Ensured export compatibility and responsive behavior

#### D. IMPLEMENT Phase ✅
- [x] Implemented collision detection functions with proper TypeScript typing
- [x] Added boundary-aware stacking algorithm with overflow protection  
- [x] Updated SVG rendering to use calculated collision-free positions
- [x] Added visual hierarchy with progressive opacity for stack depth
- [x] **Resolved ALL TypeScript Errors**: 25+ type errors fixed with comprehensive typing

#### E. QA Phase ✅
- [x] **Build Verification**: Successful compilation with zero errors
- [x] **Type Safety**: All functions properly typed with LabelPosition interface
- [x] **Boundary Testing**: Labels constrained within viewBox bounds
- [x] **Export Compatibility**: Ready for PNG/SVG export without cutoff
- [x] **Functionality Preservation**: All drag, hover, interaction behaviors maintained

### Final Implementation Summary ✅

#### Core Algorithm Architecture:
```typescript
interface LabelPosition {
  id: string; x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number;
  originalDotY: number; displayX: number; displayY: number; 
  fontSize: number; stackLevel: number; stackDirection?: number;
}

// 1. calculateLabelPositions(dots: Dot[]): Record<string, LabelPosition>
// 2. detectCollisions(label1: LabelPosition, label2: LabelPosition): boolean  
// 3. resolveCollisions(positions: Record<string, LabelPosition>): Record<string, LabelPosition>
```

#### Problem Resolution:
- **Before**: Labels overlapped and overflowed → cut off in exports → unusable
- **After**: All labels readable and within bounds → fully visible in exports → problem solved

#### Quality Assurance:
- **✅ Build Status**: Successful compilation with no TypeScript errors
- **✅ Type Safety**: Comprehensive interface definitions and null checks
- **✅ Performance**: Efficient collision detection with minimal rendering impact
- **✅ Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved and enhanced

**Status**: Task fully completed with production-ready collision detection system. All labels now stack intelligently while remaining within SVG boundaries and maintaining full export compatibility.

## Current Task: Limit Dot Name Length to 32 Characters
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement  

### Task Description
Prevent app unresponsiveness by limiting the number of characters allowed for a dot name to 32. Provide user feedback when the limit is reached, and ensure both new dot creation and dot label editing are covered.

### Problem Analysis & Solutions
- **Original Issue**: App becomes unresponsive when entering very long dot names.
- **Solution**: Add a character limit (32) to dot name input fields and show a warning when the limit is reached.

### Plan & Subtasks
- [x] Analyze all dot name input locations (add/edit)
- [x] Implement 32-character limit for dot name input fields
- [x] Add user feedback when limit is reached
- [x] Test for unresponsiveness and correct feedback
- [x] Update documentation and context

## Task: Support Dot Archiving in Export, Import, and Snapshot

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement  

### Task Description
Update the Export, Import, and Snapshot features to fully support the `archived` property for dots. Ensure that the archived status is preserved and correctly handled in all data flows.

### Plan & Subtasks

#### 1. Export: Include `archived` in Exported JSON
- [ X] Review the export logic (function that builds the export JSON)
- [X ] Ensure each dot object in the export includes the `archived` property (true/false)
- [ ] Update or add tests to verify that exported dots include the `archived` field

#### 2. Import: Accept `archived` in Imported JSON
- [ ] Review the import logic (where JSON is parsed and dots are inserted)
- [ ] Update the dot creation logic to read and set the `archived` property from the imported JSON
- [ ] Ensure that if `archived` is missing, it defaults to `false` (for old exports)
- [ ] Add/Update tests to verify that imported dots have the correct `archived` status
- [ ] Update documentation or UI hints if the import format changes

#### 3. Snapshot: Save and Restore `archived` Status
- [ ] Review the snapshot creation logic (where dots are serialized into the snapshot)
- [ ] Ensure the `archived` property is included for each dot in the snapshot data
- [ ] Review the snapshot restore logic to ensure it sets the `archived` property on dots
- [ ] Add/Update tests to verify that snapshot/restore preserves the `archived` status
- [ ] Update documentation or UI hints if the snapshot format changes

#### General/Other Considerations
- [ ] Update any type definitions or interfaces (e.g., `Dot`, `ExportData`, `Snapshot`) to ensure `archived` is always present and typed
- [ ] Communicate the change in export/import/snapshot format to users if needed (e.g., changelog, migration note)
- [ ] Consider versioning the export format if you expect more changes in the future

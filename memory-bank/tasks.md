## Current Task: Fix Password Reset Flow
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement  

### Task Description
Fix the password reset flow where users are automatically logged in instead of being prompted for a new password. The current implementation doesn't properly handle the password recovery flow.

### Problem Analysis
- User requests password reset â†’ receives email with link
- User clicks link â†’ Supabase automatically signs them in
- User is redirected to `/reset-password` but component doesn't properly handle recovery flow
- User ends up logged in without being prompted for a new password

### Plan & Subtasks

#### A. Fix Password Recovery Detection âœ…
- [x] Modify `ResetPasswordPage` to properly detect password recovery sessions
- [x] Check if user is in recovery mode using Supabase's session state
- [x] Redirect users who aren't in recovery mode to login page

#### B. Implement Proper Recovery Flow âœ…
- [x] Use `supabase.auth.verifyOtp()` to verify recovery tokens
- [x] Handle the `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event correctly
- [x] Ensure user must set new password before accessing the app

#### C. Update Authentication Provider âœ…
- [x] Add password recovery state management to `AuthProvider`
- [x] Track recovery mode in auth context
- [x] Prevent automatic login during recovery process

#### D. Enhance User Experience âœ…
- [x] Add clear messaging about password reset process
- [x] Implement password strength validation (reuse from invitation flow)
- [x] Add proper error handling for invalid/expired tokens
- [x] Provide clear success feedback

#### E. Security Improvements âœ…
- [x] Ensure recovery tokens are properly validated
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for recovery attempts
- [x] Implement proper session handling during recovery

### Implementation Details

#### Key Features Implemented
- **Recovery Detection**: Properly detects password recovery mode using Supabase auth events
- **Token Verification**: Uses `verifyOtp()` with recovery type to validate reset tokens
- **Password Strength Validation**: Reuses `SetPasswordForm` component for consistent validation
- **Debug System**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting password reset issues
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: Clear error messages and loading states
- **Security**: Proper token validation and error handling

#### Components Updated
- `ResetPasswordPage`: Completely rewritten to handle recovery flow properly
- `AuthProvider`: Added recovery mode state tracking

#### Technical Solution
- **Recovery Flow**: Properly handles Supabase password recovery using `verifyOtp` with `recovery` type
- **Session Management**: Tracks recovery mode state and prevents premature redirects
- **Password Update**: Uses `updateUser` to set the user's new password
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with debug information
- **User Experience**: Clean UI with loading states and clear feedback

#### Expected User Flow After Fix
1. **User requests password reset** â†’ receives email with reset link
2. **User clicks reset link** â†’ redirected to `/reset-password`
3. **System detects recovery mode** â†’ shows password reset form with strength validation
4. **User enters new password** â†’ validation and strength check
5. **Password updated** â†’ user redirected to main app
6. **User must sign in** with new password

#### Security Features
- **Token Validation**: Proper verification of password reset tokens
- **Recovery Mode Tracking**: Ensures users are in proper recovery state
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Enforces minimum security standards
- **Error Handling**: Prevents unauthorized access attempts

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test password reset email flow
- [ ] Test token validation with valid/invalid tokens
- [ ] Test password strength validation
- [ ] Test error handling for expired tokens
- [ ] Test successful password reset flow
- [ ] Test redirect behavior after password reset

## Previous Task: SaaS Transformation with Supabase Backend and Auth
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: Level 4 - Complex System  

### Task Description
Transform Over The Hill from a single-user, LocalStorage-based app into a multi-tenant SaaS platform.  
- Integrate Supabase for authentication and backend data storage.
- Implement sign-in (no public signup, only request access).
- Migrate all user data to Supabase with per-user isolation.
- Ensure all existing features work per-user.
- Provide secure, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

### Plan & Subtasks

#### A. Authentication & Access Control
- [x] Integrate Supabase Auth (email/password or magic link, no public signup)
- [x] Implement "Request Access" UI (user submits email, admin approves/invites)
- [x] Add sign-in page and auth gating to main UI

#### B. Data Model & Backend
- [x] Design Supabase schema for collections, dots, snapshots, etc.
- [x] Implement row-level security (RLS) for user data isolation
- [x] Set up Supabase client in Next.js app

#### C. Frontend Refactor
- [x] Replace LocalStorage logic with Supabase client calls
- [x] Add authentication state management (signed in/out, loading, etc.)
- [x] Update all data flows to be user-specific

#### E. Admin/Access Request Flow
- [x] "Request Access" form triggers email to admin or stores request in Supabase

#### F. Security & Testing
- [x] Enforce row-level security in Supabase
- [x] Test all flows: sign-in, data CRUD, access request, export

### CREATIVE Phase: UI/UX Design Plan

#### Key UX Flows
- Sign-in (no signup, only request access)
- Request Access (form, feedback, admin flow)
- Authenticated App Experience (user-specific data, sign-out)
- Import Data from JSON and store in DB (for existing users)
- Error/edge cases (access denied, pending approval, etc.)

#### UI Components Needed
- SignInForm (email/password or magic link)
- RequestAccessForm (email, message)
- AuthProvider/AuthContext (wraps app, manages auth state)
- ImportDataPrompt (modal/dialog)
- AccessStatus (pending/denied)
- SignOutButton

#### User Journey Examples
1. **New User**:  
   - Visits site â†’ sees Sign In + Request Access  
   - Requests access â†’ sees confirmation  
   - Waits for admin approval  
   - Gets invite, signs in, sees empty dashboard

2. **Existing User**:  
   - Visits site, signs in  
   - If LocalStorage data exists, prompted to import  
   - Data is migrated, user continues as normal

3. **Unauthorized User**:  
   - Tries to sign in before approval  
   - Sees "Access Pending" or "Access Denied"

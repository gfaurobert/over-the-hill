## Current Task: Stack Overlapping Dot Names on Hill Chart
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement  

### Task Description
Fix the overlapping dot name labels on the hill chart so users can read all dot names clearly when dots are positioned close together. Currently, dot labels overlap and obstruct each other when dots are clustered horizontally.

### Problem Analysis
- **Current Issue**: Dot labels were positioned at a fixed vertical offset (-35px) directly above each dot
- **Root Cause**: No collision detection - labels overlapped when dots were horizontally close
- **User Impact**: Could not read all dot names when they were clustered together
- **Solution Implemented**: Labels now stack vertically to remain readable

### Technical Analysis
- **Location**: SVG rendering in `HillChartApp.tsx` lines 985-1150
- **Previous Implementation**: Each label rendered at `(dotX, dotY - 35)` with fixed positioning
- **New Implementation**: Dynamic collision detection with vertical stacking algorithm
- **Collision Detection**: Bounding box overlap detection with upward stacking resolution

### Plan & Subtasks

#### A. VAN Phase Analysis âœ…
- [x] Identified current SVG rendering implementation in HillChartApp.tsx
- [x] Located dot label rendering logic (lines 978-1015)  
- [x] Confirmed Level 2 complexity - UI enhancement with collision detection algorithm
- [x] Analyzed label structure: rect background + text positioning

#### B. PLAN Phase âœ…
- [x] Design collision detection algorithm (bounding box detection)
- [x] Plan stacking strategy (upward movement with 8px spacing)
- [x] Define label positioning priority (left-to-right processing order)
- [x] Plan implementation approach for minimal code disruption
- [x] Design three-function architecture: calculateLabelPositions, detectCollisions, resolveCollisions

#### C. CREATIVE Phase âœ…
- [x] Design visual stacking approach and spacing (8px gaps, upward stacking)
- [x] Plan visual hierarchy with subtle opacity gradations (1.0 â†’ 0.97 â†’ 0.95)
- [x] Design responsive behavior for different chart sizes (4-10px adaptive spacing)
- [x] Specify typography hierarchy and interaction states
- [x] Create comprehensive visual specification document

#### D. IMPLEMENT Phase âœ…
- [x] Implement collision detection function (detectCollisions with bounding box logic)
- [x] Add label stacking algorithm (resolveCollisions with upward positioning)
- [x] Update SVG rendering to use calculated positions (dynamic labelPositions)
- [x] Add visual hierarchy (opacity gradations based on stack level)
- [x] Test compilation and basic functionality (build successful)

#### E. QA Phase (Next)
- [ ] Test with 2-3 overlapping dots
- [ ] Test with many clustered dots  
- [ ] Test label readability and visual hierarchy
- [ ] Test drag functionality with stacked labels
- [ ] Test responsiveness across different chart sizes

### Implementation Results âœ…

#### Successfully Implemented Features:
- **Collision Detection**: Bounding box overlap detection between label rectangles
- **Dynamic Stacking**: Upward stacking with 8px spacing between labels  
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Progressive opacity reduction (1.0 â†’ 0.97 â†’ 0.95) for depth
- **Processing Order**: Left-to-right X-coordinate sorting for predictable stacking
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing drag, hover, and styling behaviors maintained

#### Technical Implementation:
- **calculateLabelPositions()**: Pre-calculates dimensions and initial positions âœ…
- **detectCollisions()**: Bounding rectangle overlap detection âœ…  
- **resolveCollisions()**: Vertical stacking with spacing algorithm âœ…
- **Dynamic Rendering**: SVG uses calculated positions instead of fixed offsets âœ…
- **Build Verification**: Successful compilation with no errors âœ…

#### Code Changes:
- **File**: `components/HillChartApp.tsx` (lines 985-1150)
- **Approach**: Replaced fixed positioning with collision-aware dynamic positioning
- **Functions Added**: Three collision detection and stacking functions
- **Rendering Updated**: SVG elements use calculated labelPositions
- **Visual Enhancements**: Opacity-based stack hierarchy

**Status**: IMPLEMENT phase complete with successful build. Ready for QA testing with various dot configurations.

## Current Task: Stack Overlapping Dot Names on Hill Chart

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement

### Task Description

Fix the overlapping dot name labels on the hill chart so users can read all dot names clearly when dots are positioned close together. **✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED** with boundary-aware collision detection.

### Problem Analysis & Solutions ✅

- **Original Issue**: Dot labels overlapped when positioned horizontally close → **SOLVED with collision detection**
- **Critical Overflow Issue**: Stacked labels overflowed outside SVG viewBox boundaries → **SOLVED with boundary constraints**
- **Export Compatibility**: Overflowed labels were cut off in PNG/SVG exports → **FIXED with bidirectional stacking**
- **TypeScript Errors**: 25+ type errors in collision detection functions → **RESOLVED with proper typing**

### Complete Implementation Results ✅

#### Successfully Implemented Features:

- **✅ Collision Detection**: Bounding box overlap detection between label rectangles
- **✅ Boundary-Aware Stacking**: Labels stay within SVG viewBox bounds (Y: 10-160)
- **✅ Bidirectional Algorithm**: Upward stacking with downward fallback when needed
- **✅ Visual Hierarchy**: Progressive opacity gradations (1.0 → 0.97 → 0.95) for depth
- **✅ Export Compatibility**: All labels fully visible in PNG/SVG exports
- **✅ Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript type definitions and null safety

#### Technical Implementation Details:

- **LabelPosition Interface**: Comprehensive type definitions for collision detection
- **Boundary Constraints**: MIN_Y = 10, MAX_Y = 160 (within viewBox "-50 0 700 180")
- **Processing Logic**: Left-to-right sorting for predictable, consistent stacking
- **Null Safety**: Proper handling of draggingDot with conditional checks
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: O(n²) collision detection with early termination

  fontSize: number; stackLevel: number; stackDirection?: number;
}

// 1. calculateLabelPositions(dots: Dot[]): Record<string, LabelPosition>
// 2. detectCollisions(label1: LabelPosition, label2: LabelPosition): boolean  
// 3. resolveCollisions(positions: Record<string, LabelPosition>): Record<string, LabelPosition>
```

#### Problem Resolution:

## Current Task: Limit Dot Name Length to 32 Characters

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: Medium
**Type**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement

### Task Description

Prevent app unresponsiveness by limiting the number of characters allowed for a dot name to 32. Provide user feedback when the limit is reached, and ensure both new dot creation and dot label editing are covered.

### Problem Analysis & Solutions

- **Original Issue**: App becomes unresponsive when entering very long dot names.
- **Solution**: Add a character limit (32) to dot name input fields and show a warning when the limit is reached.

### Plan & Subtasks

- [X] Analyze all dot name input locations (add/edit)
- [X] Implement 32-character limit for dot name input fields
- [X] Add user feedback when limit is reached
- [X] Test for unresponsiveness and correct feedback
- [X] Update documentation and context

## Task: Support Dot Archiving in Export, Import, and Snapshot

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: High
**Type**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement

### Task Description

Update the Export, Import, and Snapshot features to fully support the `archived` property for dots. Ensure that the archived status is preserved and correctly handled in all data flows.

### Plan & Subtasks

#### 1. Export: Include `archived` in Exported JSON

- [X] Review the export logic (function that builds the export JSON)
- [X] Ensure each dot object in the export includes the `archived` property (true/false)

#### 2. Import: Accept `archived` in Imported JSON

- [X] Review the import logic (where JSON is parsed and dots are inserted)
- [X] Update the dot creation logic to read and set the `archived` property from the imported JSON
- [X] Ensure that if `archived` is missing, it defaults to `false` (for old exports)

#### 3. Snapshot: Save and Restore `archived` Status

- [X] Review the snapshot creation logic (where dots are serialized into the snapshot)
- [X] Ensure the `archived` property is included for each dot in the snapshot data
- [X] Review the snapshot restore logic to ensure it sets the `archived` property on dots

#### General/Other Considerations

- [ ] Update any type definitions or interfaces (e.g., `Dot`, `ExportData`, `Snapshot`) to ensure `archived` is always present and typed

# Password Reset Token Extraction Fix

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Password Reset Authentication Issue**

### **Issue Summary**

Users were encountering "Password Reset Error - All verification methods failed - No token found in URL parameters" when attempting to reset their passwords through email links.

### **Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Improper Token Handling**: The application was attempting to manually extract and validate tokens from URL parameters
2. **Supabase Auto-Processing**: Supabase automatically processes password reset tokens from URL hash fragments and clears them before React components can access them
3. **Timing Issues**: By the time the React component loaded, Supabase had already consumed and cleared the hash parameters
4. **Wrong Approach**: Password reset flows should rely on Supabase's auth state change events, not manual token parsing

### **Solution Implemented**

1. **Removed Manual Token Extraction**: Eliminated the `extractAndValidateToken()` approach for password reset flows
2. **Implemented Proper Auth Events**: Used Supabase's `onAuthStateChange()` to listen for `SIGNED_IN` and `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` events
3. **Simplified Password Update**: Used `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })` directly without manual token handling
4. **Added Comprehensive Debugging**: Included detailed console logging to help troubleshoot any remaining issues
5. **Extended Timeout**: Increased timeout to 8 seconds to handle slower authentication processing

### **Files Modified**

- `components/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - Complete rewrite of password reset logic
- `TOKEN_SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Updated documentation with fix details and debugging guide

### **Key Changes Made**

#### Before (Broken):

```typescript
// Manual token extraction approach (failed)
const tokenResult = extractAndValidateToken(searchParams);
if (!tokenResult.isValid) {
  setError(`Invalid password reset link: ${tokenResult.errors.join(', ')}`);
  return;
}
```

#### After (Fixed):

```typescript
// Proper Supabase auth event approach
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  if (event === 'SIGNED_IN') {
    signedInEventDetected = true;
  } else if (event === 'PASSWORD_RECOVERY') {
    recoveryEventDetected = true;
    setIsInRecoveryMode(true);
  }
});

// Simple password update in recovery mode
await supabase.auth.updateUser({ password });
```

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Password Reset Flow Test**

1. **Request Password Reset**:

   - Go to login page
   - Click "Forgot your password?"
   - Enter email address
   - Click "Send Reset Link"
   - Verify success message appears
2. **Check Email**:

   - Open email client
   - Look for password reset email
   - Verify email contains reset link with proper format
3. **Test Reset Link**:

   - Click the reset link in email
   - Should redirect to `/reset-password` page
   - Watch browser console for `[PASSWORD_RESET]` debug messages
   - Page should show "Processing Password Reset" loading state
   - Should automatically transition to password reset form
4. **Reset Password**:

   - Enter new password in form
   - Submit form
   - Should see success message
   - Should redirect to homepage after 3 seconds
   - Test login with new password

### **Debug Information Available**

If issues occur, check browser console for:

- `[PASSWORD_RESET] Starting password reset flow`
- `[PASSWORD_RESET] Current URL: [URL]`
- `[PASSWORD_RESET] Hash: [hash content]`
- `[PASSWORD_RESET] Auth state change: [event]`
- `[PASSWORD_RESET] Password recovery mode activated`

### **Expected Debug Output (Successful Flow)**:

```
[PASSWORD_RESET] Starting password reset flow
[PASSWORD_RESET] Current URL: https://app.com/reset-password#access_token=...&type=recovery
[PASSWORD_RESET] Hash: #access_token=...&type=recovery
[PASSWORD_RESET] Auth state change: SIGNED_IN
[PASSWORD_RESET] User signed in during recovery
[PASSWORD_RESET] Auth state change: PASSWORD_RECOVERY
[PASSWORD_RESET] Password recovery mode activated
[PASSWORD_RESET] Updating password
[PASSWORD_RESET] Password updated successfully
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

1. **"Password reset verification timed out"**

   - Check Supabase Site URL configuration
   - Verify email redirect URL points to `/reset-password`
   - Ensure redirect URL is in Supabase allowed redirect URLs list
2. **"Not in password recovery mode"**

   - Check if `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event is firing in console
   - Verify user clicked valid, non-expired reset link
   - Check Supabase email template uses `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`
3. **Reset link opens but shows error immediately**

   - Check browser console for auth state change events
   - Verify Supabase configuration matches production environment
   - Test with different browsers to rule out browser-specific issues

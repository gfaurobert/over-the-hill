# Active Context

## Current Focus
**SaaS Transformation (Level 4) - CREATIVE Phase**

- Designing UI/UX for authentication, access request, and Supabase integration
- All user data to be stored in Supabase, per-user isolation
- No public signup: sign-in only, with request access flow
- Migration/import for existing users
- Error/edge case handling (access denied, pending, etc.)

## Key Context Points
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- Supabase Auth and backend
- User-specific data flows
- UI/UX components: SignInForm, RequestAccessForm, AuthProvider, ImportDataPrompt, AccessStatus, SignOutButton
- User journeys: new user, existing user, unauthorized user

## Project State
- CREATIVE phase in progress for SaaS transformation
- All implementation to follow documented design flows

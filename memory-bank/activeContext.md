# Active Context

## Current Focus
**SaaS Transformation (Level 4) - COMPLETED**

- ✅ Full SaaS transformation completed: multi-tenant, per-user data isolation
- ✅ Supabase backend integration for all data (collections, dots, snapshots, preferences)
- ✅ Authentication and access request flow implemented (invite-only, no public signup)
- ✅ All user data migrated from LocalStorage to Supabase
- ✅ UI/UX updated for authentication, onboarding, and access management
- ✅ Snapshot system, export, and all core features fully integrated with backend

## Key Context Points
- All features now operate on a per-user basis with secure backend storage
- Access is managed via request/invite flow; no public signup
- LocalStorage is deprecated in favor of Supabase for persistence
- Robust error handling and user feedback for all auth/data flows
- All user journeys tested: new user, existing user migration, unauthorized access

## Project State
- SaaS transformation fully implemented and tested
- All user flows working as specified
- Ready for further enhancements, optimizations, or new features

# Session Validation Fix - Collections Data Lost on Page Refresh

## Problem Summary

When users refresh the page, all collections data disappears even though they remain logged in. The console shows these errors:

```
POST /api/auth/validate 503 (Service Unavailable)
[SESSION_VALIDATION] Validation failed: Server-side validation not available in development mode (SERVER_VALIDATION_UNAVAILABLE)
[SESSION_VALIDATION] Falling back to client-side validation
```

## Root Cause

The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable is not set in the production environment. This causes:

1. **Server-side session validation fails** (503 error)
2. **Middleware authentication fails** (cannot validate tokens)
3. **Client-side fallback is unreliable** (doesn't preserve collections data properly)
4. **User state becomes unstable** during authentication validation
5. **Collections data fails to load** due to unstable user context

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Environment Variable Validation

**Added:** `check-env.js` script to validate required environment variables

```bash
node check-env.js
```

This script:
- Checks for all required Supabase environment variables
- Provides clear error messages and setup instructions
- Prevents deployments with missing critical variables

### 2. Improved Client-Side Validation Fallback

**Modified:** `lib/services/sessionValidationService.ts`

- Enhanced client-side validation to be more reliable
- Better caching of validation results
- Reset consecutive failures on successful client-side validation
- More robust error handling

### 3. Enhanced AuthProvider Resilience

**Modified:** `components/AuthProvider.tsx`

- Better handling of initial session state during page refresh
- Mark session as valid immediately if we have a valid access token
- Preserve user data during authentication state transitions
- More stable session validation process

### 4. HillChartApp Data Loading Improvements

**Modified:** `components/HillChartApp.tsx`

- Added better logging for debugging data loading issues
- More robust error handling for data fetching
- Clearer distinction between loading states and signed-out states
- Prevent data clearing during temporary authentication states

### 5. Updated Deployment Process

**Modified:** `deploy.sh`

- Added environment variable check before deployment
- Prevents deployments with missing critical variables
- Clear error messages for deployment failures

### 6. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

**Updated:** `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

- Added specific section for this issue
- Step-by-step solution instructions
- Prevention strategies
- Clear identification of symptoms

## How to Fix the Issue

### For Production Deployment (PM2)

1. **Get your Supabase Service Role Key:**
   - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Select your project
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **API**
   - Copy the **service_role** key

2. **Set the environment variable:**
   ```bash
   pm2 stop over-the-hill
   pm2 set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY "your_service_role_key_here"
   pm2 restart over-the-hill
   ```

3. **Verify the fix:**
   ```bash
   node check-env.js
   ```

### For Local Development

1. **Create `.env.local` file:**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

2. **Restart the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Login to your account**
2. **Create some collections and dots**
3. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Verify collections data persists**
5. **Check console for no authentication errors**

## Prevention

- Always run `node check-env.js` before deploying
- Include environment variable checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor application logs for authentication errors
- Set up alerts for 503 errors on authentication endpoints

## Technical Details

### Why This Happens

1. **Page Refresh Triggers Authentication Flow:**
   - Browser loads page with cached tokens
   - Middleware attempts server-side token validation
   - AuthProvider initializes and validates session

2. **Missing Service Role Key Breaks Chain:**
   - Middleware validation fails → returns 503
   - API validation fails → returns 503  
   - Client falls back to unreliable client-side validation

3. **Unstable User State Prevents Data Loading:**
   - User state becomes null/undefined during validation
   - Collections loading effect doesn't trigger properly
   - Data appears to be "lost" but is actually not loaded

### The Fix Ensures

1. **Stable Authentication State:** Better handling of initial session validation
2. **Reliable Data Loading:** Collections load even during authentication transitions
3. **Proper Error Handling:** Clear error messages and fallback mechanisms
4. **Prevention:** Environment checks prevent deployment with missing variables

## Monitoring

After applying the fix, monitor for:

- ✅ No 503 errors on `/api/auth/validate`
- ✅ Collections data persists on page refresh
- ✅ Console shows successful session validation
- ✅ No authentication-related errors in logs

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after applying the fix:

1. **Revert environment variable changes**
2. **Restart the application**
3. **Check logs for new errors**
4. **Contact support with error details**

The client-side improvements are backward compatible and provide better fallback behavior even without the service role key.
